#### Neural-network-in-Theano-from-Scratch
This code builds a Neural Network using theano and optimises the weights using GD algorithm.
This code uses random generated data as inputs and you can raplace the part with your dataset, if needed.
Some of the parameters sucha s Learning rate and number of batch size are fixed and you can change them in code as per your requirements.
