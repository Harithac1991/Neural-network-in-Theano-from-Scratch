#### Neural-network-in-Theano-from-Scratch
This code builds a Neural Network using theano and optimises the weights using GD algorithm.
This code uses random generated data as input and you can raplace the part with your dataset, if needed.
Some of the parameters such as Learning rate and batch size are fixed and you can change them in code as per your requirement.
